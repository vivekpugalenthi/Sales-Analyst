# Sales-Analyst

introduction
Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.

Cleaning the data:
Identify and handle missing values using .is null() in SQL.
Remove duplicate rows using Distinct  in SQL “Remove Duplicates”.
Standardize text values like Customer name,AddressLine2
Rename column headers to be clean and uniform (e.g., lowercase, no spaces).
